# ICSE-2022-148
This repository provides data for the ICSE 2022 submission #148.

File "empirical study on divide-by-zero.xlsx" shows the result of our empirical study of
existing divide-by-zero bugs. Specifically, it lists the classification results of the bugs
into Class Src, Class Bd, and Class Un, as discussed in the paper.

File "confiremd-bugs.md" provides links to the bug reports of the confirmed divide-by-zero bugs 
found by our tool. We hide some of the links to bug reports due to the double-blind requirement.
We are willing to send these links to the PC chair for verification (or share them in any way that the reviewers consider appropriate). They will be added upon acceptance of the paper.
