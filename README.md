# ICSE-2022-148
This repository provides data for the ICSE 2022 submission #148.

File "empirical study on divide-by-zero.xlsx" shows the result of our empirical study of
existing divide-by-zero bugs. Specifically, it lists the classification results of the bugs
into Class Src, Class Bd, and Class Un, as discussed in the paper.

File "confiremd-bugs.md" provides links to the bug reports of the confirmed divide-by-zero bugs 
found by our tool. We hide some of the links due to the double blind requirement. They will be 
added upon acceptance of the paper.
